#README

Dungeon is the working title of an HTML5 game made with the ImpactJS game engine. It uses the impact-node server instead of Impact's built-in PHP solution for the Weltmeister editor and for baking.

#The game


- The game is based around the swiping gameplay of an iPhone which switches from one room to the next. If you encounter an enemy you have to flee and remember the maze.
- In pre-alpha experimental stage
- Version 0.1.1

#Setup

- Install the impact-node server by typing ```npm install -g impact-node``` and then type ```impact-node serve``` and go to http://localhost:3000
- Does not require ```impact-node``` but is set up for it and is missing some of Impact's tools for building using bake script.
- Dev code changes are seen in localhost:3000. To build, type ```impact-node build```</li>
</ul>
